# skylOS

This is a father-son project between Robert Karhnak (father) and Paul Karhnak
(son). The name for skylOS comes from [Byzantine/Koine Greek for
"dog"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/σκύλος#Greek), and is dedicated to
various wonderful dogs we've had over the years: Hannah, Rosa, Gibbs, Jose, and
Paco.

skylOS is inspired by Linux and developed in a Linux build environment.
However, skylOS does not attempt to follow formal POSIX standards, and it is
not intended to be meaningfully "Unix-like". Rather, skylOS is primarily a
hobbyist project. 

# Targets

skylOS is currently being developed as a 64-bit kernel for the Raspberry Pi 5.

# Acknowledgments

Dad is the one who got me into computers to begin with; in many respects, this
project would not be possible without him.
